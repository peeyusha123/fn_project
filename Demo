Here is a simplified explanation of the five test cases from the SIT Evidence document in my own words:


---

1. TC_01: Only One Site ID Can Have SARF SITE = YES

When updating the SARF SITE field, only one site within a project can have "YES" at a time.

If an attempt is made to set more than one site to "YES," the system prevents the update and shows an error.



---

2. TC_02: Restriction on Projects Created After 7/14/2022

The system does not allow SARF SITE updates for projects that were created after July 14, 2022.

If an attempt is made to modify SARF SITE for such a project, the update will not be saved, and an error message will appear.



---

3. TC_03: Successful Update of SARF SITE to YES

If all conditions are met (only one "YES" per project, valid project creation date), the system allows the update.

A confirmation popup appears, asking for user approval before saving the changes.

After confirmation, SARF SITE is successfully updated in the system.



---

4. TC_04: Error Handling for Invalid Project ID Search

When searching for a project, the system only accepts Initial Build Project IDs.

If a wrong project type is entered, the system displays an error message stating that only Initial Build Project IDs are allowed.



---

5. TC_05: SARF SITE Privilege is Hidden from Admin UI

The new privilege for SARF SITE visibility is not displayed in the privileges management page in the admin section.

This means the privilege cannot be assigned or modified through the UI and can only be added from the backend.



---

Summary:

1. Only one site can have SARF SITE = YES.


2. No updates for projects created after 7/14/2022.


3. Updates show confirmation popups before saving.


4. Only Initial Build Project IDs can be used for searching.


5. The SARF SITE privilege is hidden from the admin panel.



This is a clear and easy-to-explain summary of the test cases. Let me know if you need further simplifications!
