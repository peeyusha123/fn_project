Acceptance Criteria:
AC-1: GIVEN the primary candidate selection (rf accept & ranking task) is completed
WHEN the system queries the fuze NEPA table
THEN if there is a match on base location IDs, the system sends the SPM project ID, Site ID, and Site name to fuze NEPA.AC-2: GIVEN The Submit Structure Form is completed
WHEN the system queries the fuze NEPA table
THEN if there is a match on base location IDs, the system sends the SPM project ID, Site ID, and Site name to fuze NEPA.AC-3: GIVEN the SPM project ID, Site ID, and Site name are sent to fuze NEPA
WHEN the NEPA module processes the data
THEN the NEPA module sends the “Bulk Analysis Approved?” value to SPM.AC-4: GIVEN the NEPA module sends the “Bulk Analysis Approved?” value to SPM
WHEN the value is received
THEN it is reflected in the Submit for NEPA task.

Description
Upon completion of the primary candidate selection (rf accept & ranking task), the SPM system should query the fuze NEPA table. If there is a match on base location IDs, the system should send the SPM project ID, Site ID, and Site name to fuze NEPA to be populated in the MDU bulk analysis table. The NEPA module will then send the “Bulk Analysis Approved?” value to SPM to reflect in the Submit for NEPA task.
RK-1: Performance issues with large datasets.,RK-2: Integration with existing Fuze NEPA functionalities.
AS-1: Fuze NEPA database schema is available.,AS-2: Necessary database permissions are granted.
