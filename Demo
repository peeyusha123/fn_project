Demo Explanation in Simple Words

1. Introduction

"Hello everyone, today I am going to show how the system allows or blocks site status changes based on whether a site is a SARF site or not. Also, only users with the GUI_SUPPORT role can make these updates."

2. Step-by-Step Demo

Step 1: Checking if the Site is a SARF Site

"First, I am going to enter a Site ID and check if it is a SARF site or not."

If SARF_SITE = YES, the site can be updated.

If SARF_SITE = NO, the site cannot be updated.

Step 2: Updating Site Status for SARF Sites

"Now, I am going to update the site status for a SARF site."

Since this is a SARF site, the system allows the change.

The update is saved successfully.

Step 3: Trying to Update a Non-SARF Site

"Next, I am going to try updating a site that is not a SARF site."

The system blocks the update and shows an error message.

The site status does not change.

Step 4: Ensuring Only GUI_SUPPORT Users Can Update Status

"Now, I am going to try updating the site status with a user who does not have the GUI_SUPPORT role."

The system does not allow the update.

Only users with GUI_SUPPORT role can change the site status.

3. Conclusion
