Sprint:2025.DC-3.1
Story Points:8
Description
As a Network Planner, I want a new read-only site-level field called 'P2P STL' in the tracker and SPM Site details page so I can easily identify sites with P2P STL paths.

This field will be read only except for allowing editing by only the “FAA SUPER USER” role (existing role)

Data Population logic (by system) :

Populate this field with YES if: A budget code of “5GSTL” is detected on any project under the site where the project status != cancelled (this would include future projects as created)
Automatically set the site P2P STL field(only if the existing value is YES) to ‘Decommissioned’ when the Construction Completed MS of the dismantlement mod project is completed.
RK-1: Data migration might cause downtime.
AS-1: Database schema allows for the addition of a new column.












P2P Link STL Site Decommissioning & Relocation Guidelines

The P2P Link STL site installations are used to meet and maintain the license compliance requirements for our market-based licenses.  When a P2P link STL installation is decommissioned from a site, it must be restored within the same license boundary* within 180 days of the decommissioning to maintain Safe Harbor license compliance for the license

P2P Link STL site decommissioning guidance
SPM List of Active 28GHz P2P STL Sites
Please ensure the P2P STL link is included in the build design of the new site or shelter relocation
Reach out to the Aviat or Ericsson vendor contact below to schedule the new installation of the relocated P2P Link STL site
Aviat - Sam Hall - Sam.Hall@aviatnet.com
Ericsson - Tom Matney - thomas.matney@ericsson.com
MW ISA project will need to be submitted via the MW FUZE module for the new P2P Link STL site 
Vendor must provide the NRC License Compliance team with a MW data sheet once the new P2P Link STL site is activated  
Notify via e-mail the NRC License Compliance team of the planned P2P Link STL site decommissioning
In the notification,  identify the planned site for the new installation, including details such as Fuze Site ID, SPM proj ID, County & State, and timeline for new P2P Link STL site activation
Whenever possible, activate the new P2P Link STL site before decommissioning the existing P2P Link STL site to avoid a Loss of Safe Harbor Compliance for the license
If an outage of the existing P2P Link STL site longer than 15 days will occur, notify via e-mail the NRC License Compliance team of the planned P2P Link STL site outage as well as the date of existing P2P Link STL site decommissioning
P2P STL link outages must be less than 180 days in order to maintain Safe Harbor license compliance.  Failure to meet this requirement will result in the loss of Safe Harbor expedited renewal process and incur an exhaustive and rigorous logging of all future outages of the P2P Link STL sites in the county for as long as Verizon holds the license.
What this means:
Consistent P2P Link STL site decommissioning processes across all markets and spectrum types
Accurate records of P2P Link STL site decommissioning for Safe Harbor license compliance maintenance   

Please contact LicensingCompliance@verizonwireless.com if you have any questions.

*28GHz license boundaries are the county of the current P2P Link STL site location.  39GHz & C-Band license boundaries are at the PEA level.  Please reach out to the NRC License Compliance team if you are unsure of the license boundary for the P2P Link STL site that is being decommissioned.




















Objective: Bring visibility to sites that have Point-to-Point (P2P) Save the License (STL) paths installed at them to mitigate scenarios where markets are dismantling or relocating these sites without activating the path at the new site. Prevent possible loss of license by not meeting FCC build out numbers.

iNSPIRE Initiative ID: I-1693
iNSPIRE MVP ID: M-3120

Requirements:
Create a new read-only site level field (available in tracker and SPM Site Page) called “P2P STL” that will consist of “yes” only values
This field will be read only except for allowing editing by only the “FAA SUPER USER” role (existing role)

Populate this field with YES if:
A budget code of “5GSTL” is detected on any project under the site where the project status != cancelled (this would include future projects as created)
Retrofit - this field needs to be retrofitted with “yes” values for all sites that meet the above condition
Anytime a dismantlement mod project is created under a site where “P2P STL” field = YES, display a banner within the SPM dismantlement project that states:
There is a P2P STL path or paths at this site to protect mmWave license(s). Please ensure that this P2P path(s) is/are moved and activated to the relocation site. Please refer to the guidance P2P Link STL Site Decommissioning & Relocation Guidelines 
Anytime a High Rent Relo or Relocation relationship exists on a site where “P2P STL” field = YES, display a banner in the child project ID (replacement site) which states:
The site you are relocating has a current P2P STL path or paths to protect mmWave license(s). Please ensure that path(s) is/are installed and activated under this relocation project.  Please refer to the guidance P2P Link STL Site Decommissioning & Relocation Guidelines 
Once the P2P Link is established and operational at its new site location (this will be known when the vendor sends the datasheet), the NRC License Compliance team will manually set the P2P STL site field to ‘Yes’. 
Automatically set the dismantlement site P2P STL field to ‘Decommissioned’ when the Construction Completed MS of the dismantlement mod project is completed.
The 5G STL MW Links_rev1 (site custom field) counts will be manually updated by the NRC License Compliance team.

*HQ Spectrum Team can create a tracker to have visibility into any P2P sites that are pending a relo or dismantlement

Simplified Description and Acceptance Criteria

Description

Currently, when a new project is created, utility information is duplicated instead of being inherited from the site. Each new project entry creates a new utility ID, leading to unnecessary duplication.

Expected behavior:

The project's utility information should be the same as the site's utility information.

Utilities should not be duplicated when a new project is created.

If the site’s utility information is incomplete, an error should be shown when creating a new project.


Acceptance Criteria

AC-1:
Given a new project is created,
When the API request is made,
Then the project's utility information should come from the site's utility data without duplication.

AC-2:
Given a site has incomplete utility information,
When a new project is created,
Then an error message should be displayed indicating missing utility information.

This simplified version should help you generate clear test cases. Let me know if you need further refinements!













As an Equipment Engineer, I want to receive real-time notifications about the status of the path creation process (Success, Failure, or Manual Intervention) so that I can track progress, take necessary actions, and ensure the smooth execution of workflows.

The path creation process is triggered after the successful creation of equipment in the CND application. If the process completes successfully, a success notification is sent to the user. If the process encounters an error, a failure notification is sent with details. If manual intervention is required, a notification with a redirect link is provided for further action.

The system should ensure that notifications are sent within 5 seconds of the workflow reaching a terminal state (Success, Failure, or Manual Intervention). Additionally, any failures should trigger automated retries where applicable.

Acceptance Criteria

AC-1 (Success Notification):

Given the path creation process completes successfully,

When the workflow finishes,

Then the user receives a success notification within 5 seconds.


AC-2 (Manual Intervention Notification):

Given the workflow encounters a condition requiring manual intervention,

When the system identifies this condition,

Then the user receives a notification with a redirect link within 5 seconds.


AC-3 (Failure Notification):

Given the path creation process encounters an error,

When the workflow fails,

Then the user receives a failure notification with error details within 5 seconds.



The system must ensure high reliability in API integration, minimize notification delays, and provide accurate status updates to maintain an efficient workflow for the Equipment Engineer.








Detailed Description for SARF SITE Management Feature

Objective

The SARF SITE management feature enables GUI SUPPORT users to view and update SARF SITE values for different sites. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate site data and ensuring proper classification of sites within the system. Users can:

Search for site details (including SARF SITE values).

Update SARF SITE values for individual sites.

Update both SARF SITE and site status together.

Perform bulk updates to modify multiple sites in a single request.

Ensure data security by restricting updates to authorized users only.


This feature interacts with two key APIs:

1. getCandidateSites API – Retrieves site details, including SARF SITE value.


2. updateSarfSite API – Updates the SARF SITE value (YES/NO) and can modify the site status.




---

Feature Behavior

1. Fetching Site Details

The system allows users to search for sites using siteProjectsId and status.

The API response includes Site ID, Site Name, MDG Location ID, Market, SARF SITE value, and other details.

If a site exists, it returns the current SARF SITE value (YES/NO).

If no matching site is found, the API responds with an appropriate message.



2. Updating SARF SITE Value

Users can modify SARF SITE from YES to NO or vice versa using the updateSarfSite API.

The system updates the value in the database and confirms the change in the API response.

Only authorized users with the GUI SUPPORT role can make changes.



3. Updating SARF SITE and Site Status Together

Users can modify both SARF SITE and site status in a single request.

The system ensures that both values are updated in the database at the same time.

The API response reflects the updated values.



4. Bulk Updates for Multiple Sites

Users can submit multiple site updates in a single request.

The system processes all updates and returns a success or failure status for each site.

If one or more updates fail, the API provides a partial success message detailing the affected sites.



5. Security & Access Control

Only users with the GUI SUPPORT role can modify SARF SITE values.

Unauthorized access attempts result in a 403 Forbidden error.

Sensitive site details are protected, and only necessary information is exposed in API responses.





---

Acceptance Criteria

AC-1: Fetching Site Details

✅ When a GUI SUPPORT user searches for a site using getCandidateSites, the API must return the correct site details, including SARF SITE value.
✅ The API response must match the actual database records for the site.
✅ If an invalid siteProjectsId is provided, the system must return an error message instead of incorrect data.

AC-2: Updating SARF SITE Value

✅ When a GUI SUPPORT user updates a site's SARF SITE value, the new value must be stored in the database and reflected in API responses.
✅ The system must allow only valid SARF SITE values (YES/NO) and reject any invalid input.
✅ If an unauthorized user attempts to update SARF SITE, the system must return a 403 Forbidden error.

AC-3: Updating SARF SITE and Site Status Together

✅ When a user updates both SARF SITE and site status, the system must process both changes simultaneously.
✅ The database must accurately reflect the new SARF SITE and status values after the update.
✅ If an invalid status value is provided, the update must fail with a validation error.

AC-4: Bulk Updates for Multiple Sites

✅ The system must allow users to update multiple sites in a single request.
✅ The API response must indicate which updates were successful and which failed, with proper error messages.
✅ The system must enforce a limit on maximum sites per bulk update request to prevent performance issues.

AC-5: Data Security & Access Control

✅ Only GUI SUPPORT users should be able to update SARF SITE values.
✅ Unauthorized users attempting updates must receive a 403 Forbidden error.
✅ The system must protect sensitive site information and ensure only relevant fields are returned in API responses.

Description:

The user navigates to the Admin Page and selects Admin Operations. Within the Admin Operations section, the user selects Document Routing, where two options are available:

1. Template List


2. Create/Edit Template



The user selects Create/Edit Template, fills in the required fields, and successfully creates a template. The created template is then verified in the Template List to ensure its visibility.

Next, the user selects a Project ID, which opens the Project Page. Within the project, a specific Milestone is selected, and the user attempts to upload documents. After uploading, the user verifies that the document appears on the Milestone Page. Additionally, the Document Routing icon is checked to confirm whether the uploaded document is in Jeopardy status.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The user can navigate to the Admin Page and access the Document Routing section.


2. The Create/Edit Template functionality allows users to input required fields and create a template successfully.


3. The created template appears in the Template List after creation.


4. The user can select a Project ID and access the Project Page.


5. Within the Project Page, a Milestone can be selected to upload a document.


6. The uploaded document is visible on the Milestone Page after a successful upload.


7. The Document Routing icon correctly reflects the document’s Jeopardy status, if applicable.

Demo Explanation for "Source Site" Field on Site Page UI

1. Introduction

"Hello everyone, today I am going to demonstrate the addition of the "Source Site" field to the Site Page UI and the Tracker Module. This field corresponds to the backend SARF SITE field and displays either Yes/No or True/False. It has been placed under Site Status on the Site Page."


---

2. Step-by-Step Demo

Step 1: Verifying "Source Site" Field on Site Page UI

"I am opening the Site Page UI using the given UAT environment link to check if the Source Site field is displayed correctly under Site Status."

Test Case Reference (TC_01):

The Source Site field should be visible on the Site Page.

It should be placed directly under the Site Status field.

The field should display Yes/No or True/False based on the backend SARF SITE value.



Expected Result: The Source Site field appears correctly under Site Status and shows the expected values.


---

Step 2: Checking "Source Site" Field in the Tracker Module

"Now, I am checking if the Source Site field is also available in the Tracker Module."

Test Case Reference (TC_02):

The Source Site field should be present in the site module in Tracker.

The field should display the same Yes/No or True/False value as in the Site Page UI.

The value should match the backend SARF SITE field.



Expected Result: The Tracker Module correctly displays the Source Site field with the expected values, ensuring consistency with the Site Page UI.


---

Step 3: Querying the Backend to Validate Source Site Data

"Now, I am going to run a database query to check if the Source Site value is correctly stored in the backend."

Query:

SELECT site_id, site_status, sarf_site AS source_site  
FROM fuze_copy.site_info@fuze_uat_read  
WHERE site_id = 'SITE_ID';

Expected Result:

The Source Site field should match the SARF SITE value in the database.

The Yes/No or True/False values displayed on the UI should be the same as the data retrieved from this query.




---

3. Conclusion

"With this update, the Source Site field is now available in both the Site Page UI and the Tracker Module. The backend data is correctly stored and reflected on the UI, ensuring proper tracking of SARF SITE information. Thank you!"
