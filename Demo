As a (PRIVILEGE NAME TO BE CREATED)user, I need an admin page to manage SARF SITE values so I can correct and update site information. Ensure this new priviledge is not visible from privelages management page in admin section. can only be added through the backend

Page will allow users to search by initial build project ID - search results will bring all site IDs related to that project ID with a SARF site of YES/NO field for editing. If the project ID entered does not have project type = initial build, return an error to user that they can only search by initial build project ID. User will have the ability to select "YES/NO" for SARF site field for any site ID. Once user is complete with their actions, they must select an explicit "save" button.

Upon save of the users changes, the below validations needs to be implemented. if validations fail, do not merge/save the data. If validation passes. show pop up to user to confirm the SARF site will be changed to the new site

Only 1 site ID can == YES for SARF
Only allow SARF SITE field changes where the initial build project creation date field is LESS than 7/14/2022
Ensure user cannot leave any SARF SITE fields as empty - must be populated as YES or NO

fields to include:

A new "Manual Switch Name" checkbox is added to the Site page and tracker (for single/multiple project edits).

When checked, the Switch Name field becomes editable with values from the Switch Name Admin Screen (ignoring Atoll market restrictions).

Description
Upon completion of the primary candidate selection (rf accept & ranking task), the SPM system should query the fuze NEPA table. If there is a match on base location IDs, the system should send the SPM project ID, Site ID, and Site name to fuze NEPA to be populated in the MDU bulk analysis table. The NEPA module will then send the “Bulk Analysis Approved?” value to SPM to reflect in the Submit for NEPA task.
RK-1: Performance issues with large datasets.,RK-2: Integration with existing Fuze NEPA functionalities.
AS-1: Fuze NEPA database schema is available.,AS-2: Necessary database permissions are granted.
