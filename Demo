---

1. Introduction

"Hello everyone, today I will demonstrate the backend changes for updating the SARF SITE value. This update allows GUI SUPPORT users to search for site details and modify the SARF SITE field."


---

2. Step-by-Step Demo

Step 1: Fetching Site Details

"First, I will search for a site using siteProjectsId and siteInfoId. This will return all site details, including SARF SITE."

API Used: getCandidateSites

Request:

{
  "siteProjectsId": "2028099",
  "status": "Proposed,Accepted,RE-Rejected,Deleted,Primary,Live"
}

Response:
"The API returns site details such as Site ID, Site Name, MDG Location ID, and SARF SITE value. For example, the SARF SITE for site ID 616131219 is currently 'YES'."



---

Step 2: Checking SARF SITE in Database

"Before updating, I will check the current SARF SITE value in the database for this siteInfoId."

Query:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site, status, last_modified_by, last_modified_date  
FROM fuze_copy1.site_info  
WHERE site_info_id = 616131219;

Result: "The database confirms that SARF SITE is currently 'YES'."



---

Step 3: Updating the SARF SITE Value

"Now, I will update the SARF SITE value from 'YES' to 'NO' using the updateSarfSite API."

API Used: updateSarfSite

Request:

[
  {
    "siteInfoId": 616131219,
    "sarfSite": "NO",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd"
  }
]

After Update Check:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site FROM fuze_copy1.site_info WHERE site_info_id = 616131219;

"Now, the SARF SITE value is updated to 'NO' in the database."



---

Step 4: Updating SARF SITE & Site Status Together

"Next, I will update both the SARF SITE and site status at the same time."

Request:

[
  {
    "siteInfoId": 616131219,
    "sarfSite": "YES",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd",
    "status": "Primary"
  }
]

Check in Database:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site, status FROM fuze_copy1.site_info WHERE site_info_id = 616131219;

"The SARF SITE is now 'YES' and the site status is 'Primary'."



---

Step 5: Bulk Update for Multiple Sites

"Instead of updating one site at a time, I can update multiple sites in a single request."

Request:

[
  {
    "siteInfoId": 616131219,
    "sarfSite": "YES",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd",
    "status": "Live"
  },
  {
    "siteInfoId": 377022,
    "sarfSite": "YES",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd",
    "status": "Primary"
  }
]

Database Check:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site, status FROM fuze_copy1.site_info WHERE site_info_id IN (616131219, 377022);

"Now, both sites have been updated successfully."



---

3. Security & Validation

"To ensure security, only authorized GUI SUPPORT users can make changes. All updates are logged for tracking and auditing."


---

4. Conclusion

"With this update, I can easily search for site details, update the SARF SITE value, and modify site status securely and efficiently. Thank you!"
