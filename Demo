Demo Explanation for "Source Site" Field on Site Page UI

1. Introduction

"Hello everyone, today I am going to demonstrate the addition of the "Source Site" field to the Site Page UI and the Tracker Module. This field corresponds to the backend SARF SITE field and displays either Yes/No or True/False. It has been placed under Site Status on the Site Page."

2. Step-by-Step Demo

Step 1: Verifying "Source Site" Field on Site Page UI

"I am opening the Site Page UI using the given UAT environment link to check if the Source Site field is displayed correctly under Site Status."

Test Case Reference (TC_01):

The Source Site field should be visible on the Site Page.

It should be placed directly under the Site Status field.

The field should display Yes/No or True/False based on the backend SARF SITE value.



Expected Result: The Source Site field appears correctly under Site Status and shows the expected values.


---

Step 2: Checking "Source Site" Field in the Tracker Module

"Now, I am checking if the Source Site field is also available in the Tracker Module."

Test Case Reference (TC_02):

The Source Site field should be present in the site module in Tracker.

The field should display the same Yes/No or True/False value as in the Site Page UI.

The value should match the backend SARF SITE field.



Expected Result: The Tracker Module correctly displays the Source Site field with the expected values, ensuring consistency with the Site Page UI.


---

Step 3: Querying the Backend to Validate Source Site Data

"Now, I am going to run a database query to check if the Source Site value is correctly stored in the backend."

Query:

SELECT site_id, site_status, sarf_site AS source_site  
FROM fuze_copy.site_info@fuze_uat_read  
WHERE site_id = 'SITE_ID';

Expected Result:

The Source Site field should match the SARF SITE value in the database.

The Yes/No or True/False values displayed on the UI should be the same as the data retrieved from this query.

3. Conclusion

"With this update, the Source Site field is now available in both the Site Page UI and the Tracker Module. The backend data is correctly stored and reflected on the UI, ensuring proper tracking of SARF SITE information. Thank you!"
