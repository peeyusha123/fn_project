Problem statement
We have successfully created a form that accepts the correct input. But we have some problems in form for now.

The form values are not being submitted for now and the comment box is very small in size.

Use the proper HTML tags and elements to get the desired output.



Expected Output:-


no image



Steps:-


1. You have given a Sample HTML code, scroll down to the end of the code. 

2. You will find the form tag in which the specified input fields are given. It would more appropriate if you made the desired changes as mentioned in the Test cases. 

3. The comment box should have the id as "comment" and the tag to be used for comments will be "textarea".

4. Submit the solution after applying the changes and check if the test cases are passed or not.


Test Cases:-


1- Textarea's properties should be expected as below: -

a. Form should contain one "textarea" tag before the inputs. 
b. Comments could be easily written inside the textarea. 
2- The dimensions of the comment box should be expected as below:-

a- textarea tag should be used with proper attributes such as rows and cols.
b- The row and column dimensions should be 10 and 30 respectively. 
3- The form's submit button should be present.

a. Input tag of type "submit" should be present at the end of the form. 


Note:-


 All the changes need to be done inside the form tag.
