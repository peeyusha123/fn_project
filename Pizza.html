    <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive
        oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in
        a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.
        One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato
        sauce, mozzarella, and basil. </p>

    <p>Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with
        buffalo mozzarella (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte (mozzarella
        produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano (a
        variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) and
        uses onions and olives. The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to
        olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions
        outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.</p>
