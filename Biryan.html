<body>
    <p>Italy has many variations of pizza. The Neapolitan pizza, or Naples-style pizza, is made specifically with
        buffalo mozzarella (produced from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo) or fior di latte (mozzarella
        produced from the milk of prized Agerolese cows) and with San Marzano tomatoes or pomodorino vesuviano (a
        variety of grape tomato grown in Naples). Roman pizza often omits tomatoes (an early 16th-century import) and
        uses onions and olives. The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to
        olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions
        outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics of a Good Biryani</h2>
    <p>While practice makes a biryani perfect, the importance of the key ingredients cannot be ruled out by true biryani
        lovers.

        Fresh vegetables/finest meat cuts and poultry as well as fresh seafood, adding to the flavor of a biryani.
        The finest long-grained rice for a good north Indian biryani and short-grained rice for a South Indian biryani.
        A well-balanced marinade comprising curd, herbs, and spices is integral to a good biryani.
        Delicate, aromatic spices, typical of the region, giving each type of biryani its distinctive taste.
        It might surprise most people that versions of biryani are not limited to the Indian subcontinent. Various
        countries around the world have created their own version of the dish, with some popular ones being Malaysian,
        Filipino, Mauritian, and African.</p>
