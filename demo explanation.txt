1)Backend - Create an admin page for GUI_SUPPORT only that allows users to change the SARF SITE value on sites:-
---getCandidateSites API helps to  find site details including the sarf Site value
---updateSarfSite API allows  to change the sarf site values(yes/no)for any site
---using userid and project id searches for site , fetches all details ,including sarf site status and mdg location id.
---the api returns site details such as site id,site name,mdg location,sarf site value.
API Used: getCandidateSites

Request:

{
  "siteProjectsId": "2028099",
  "status": "Proposed,Accepted,RE-Rejected,Deleted,Primary,Live"
}

Response:
"The API returns site details such as Site ID, Site Name, MDG Location ID, and SARF SITE value. For example, the SARF SITE for site ID 616131219 is currently 'YES'."
---"Before updating, I will check the current SARF SITE value in the database for this siteInfoId."

Query:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site, status, last_modified_by, last_modified_date  
FROM fuze_copy1.site_info  
WHERE site_info_id = 616131219;

Result: "The database confirms that SARF SITE is currently 'YES'."

---"Now, I will update the SARF SITE value from 'YES' to 'NO' using the updateSarfSite API."

API Used: updateSarfSite

Request:

[
  {
    "siteInfoId": 616131219,
    "sarfSite": "NO",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd"
  }
]

After Update Check:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site FROM fuze_copy1.site_info WHERE site_info_id = 616131219;

"Now, the SARF SITE value is updated to 'NO' in the database."

---"Next, I will update both the SARF SITE and site status at the same time."

Request:

[
  {
    "siteInfoId": 616131219,
    "sarfSite": "YES",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd",
    "status": "Primary"
  }
]

Check in Database:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site, status FROM fuze_copy1.site_info WHERE site_info_id = 616131219;

"The SARF SITE is now 'YES' and the site status is 'Primary'."
----Step 5: Bulk Update for Multiple Sites

"Instead of updating one site at a time, I can update multiple sites in a single request."

Request:

[
  {
    "siteInfoId": 616131219,
    "sarfSite": "YES",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd",
    "status": "Live"
  },
  {
    "siteInfoId": 377022,
    "sarfSite": "YES",
    "lastModifiedBy": "kja2hhd",
    "status": "Primary"
  }
]

Database Check:

SELECT site_info_id, sarf_site, status FROM fuze_copy1.site_info WHERE site_info_id IN (616131219, 377022);

"Now, both sites have been updated successfully."




2)Backend - Create a new privilege for SARF Site visibility
we have created new privileges to control sarf  site visibility. only users with spm_super_user privilege can see the sarf site value in api response.this
ensures data security by restricting access to sensitive site information.


3)frontend -Create an admin page for GUI_SUPPORT only that allows users to change the SARF SITE value on sites


--TC_01: Only One Site ID Can Have SARF SITE = YES

When updating the SARF SITE field, only one site within a project can have "YES" at a time.

If an attempt is made to set more than one site to "YES," the system prevents the update and shows an error.



---

-- TC_02: Restriction on Projects Created After 7/14/2022

The system does not allow SARF SITE updates for projects that were created after July 14, 2022.

If an attempt is made to modify SARF SITE for such a project, the update will not be saved, and an error message will appear.



---

-- TC_03: Successful Update of SARF SITE to YES

If all conditions are met (only one "YES" per project, valid project creation date), the system allows the update.

A confirmation popup appears, asking for user approval before saving the changes.

After confirmation, SARF SITE is successfully updated in the system.



---

-- TC_04: Error Handling for Invalid Project ID Search

When searching for a project, the system only accepts Initial Build Project IDs.

If a wrong project type is entered, the system displays an error message stating that only Initial Build Project IDs are allowed.



---

-- TC_05: SARF SITE Privilege is Hidden from Admin UI

The new privilege for SARF SITE visibility is not displayed in the privileges management page in the admin section.

This means the privilege cannot be assigned or modified through the UI and can only be added from the backend.




4)Implement a validation that does not allow users to change the SPM site status on non SARF sites

select * from fuze_sit1.site_info@fuze_uat_read;
--Step 1: Checking if the Site is a SARF Site

"First, I am going to enter a Site ID and check if it is a SARF site or not."

If SARF_SITE = YES, the site can be updated.

If SARF_SITE = NO, the site cannot be updated.



---

--Step 2: Updating Site Status for SARF Sites

"Now, I am going to update the site status for a SARF site."

Since this is a SARF site, the system allows the change.

The update is saved successfully.



---

--Step 3: Trying to Update a Non-SARF Site

"Next, I am going to try updating a site that is not a SARF site."

The system blocks the update and shows an error message.

The site status does not change.



---

--Step 4: Ensuring Only GUI_SUPPORT Users Can Update Status

"Now, I am going to try updating the site status with a user who does not have the GUI_SUPPORT role."

The system does not allow the update.

Only users with GUI_SUPPORT role can change the site status.


5)Create "Source Site" field on the Site Page

--Step 1: Verifying "Source Site" Field on Site Page UI

"I am opening the Site Page UI using the given UAT environment link to check if the Source Site field is displayed correctly under Site Status."

Test Case Reference (TC_01):

The Source Site field should be visible on the Site Page.

It should be placed directly under the Site Status field.

The field should display Yes/No or True/False based on the backend SARF SITE value.



Expected Result: The Source Site field appears correctly under Site Status and shows the expected values.


---

---Step 2: Checking "Source Site" Field in the Tracker Module

"Now, I am checking if the Source Site field is also available in the Tracker Module."

Test Case Reference (TC_02):

The Source Site field should be present in the site module in Tracker.

The field should display the same Yes/No or True/False value as in the Site Page UI.

The value should match the backend SARF SITE field.



Expected Result: The Tracker Module correctly displays the Source Site field with the expected values, ensuring consistency with the Site Page UI.


---

--Step 3: Querying the Backend to Validate Source Site Data

"Now, I am going to run a database query to check if the Source Site value is correctly stored in the backend."

Query:

SELECT site_id, site_status, sarf_site AS source_site  
FROM fuze_copy.site_info@fuze_uat_read  
WHERE site_id = 'SITE_ID';

Expected Result:

The Source Site field should match the SARF SITE value in the database.

The Yes/No or True/False values displayed on the UI should be the same as the data retrieved from this query.
